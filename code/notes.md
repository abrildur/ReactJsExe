# React can be used to control, parts of HTML pages or entire pages.
#---> "Widget" approach on a multipage-app. Some pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server.
# React can also be used to control the entire frontend of a web app.
--> "Single-page-app" (SPA) approach. Server only sends one HTML page thereafter. React takes over and controls the UI.


---------------------
REACT JS ALTERNATIVES.

React.js -> lean and focused component-based UI Library. Certain features (e.g. routing) are added via community pages.

Angular.js-> Complete component-based UI Framework, packed with features. Uses Typescript. Can be overkill for smaller projects.

Vue.js -> mix between angular and react. Complete compoent-based UI Framework. Includes more core features. A little less popular than react and angular. (Rely less in the community. Not as much overrload than angular)
more features than react, less than angular.
